# Banana Leaf Classification Using Deep Learning with Vision Transformers Architecture

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify banana leaves into three categories: healthy leaves, diseased leaves, and leaves eaten by animals. The dataset was collected and processed independently, resulting in the following details:

## Dataset
| Type               | Quantity | Source         |
|--------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Healthy Leaves      | 165      | Manual Search   |
| Diseased Leaves     | 245      | Manual Search   |
| Leaves Eaten by Animals | 144  | Manual Search   |
| **Total**          | **554**  |                 |

## Model
The model was developed using the Vision Transformer architecture.

## Training Results
- **Epoch:** 20
- **Training Loss:** 0.0024
- **Validation Loss:** 0.003645
- **Accuracy:** 100%

After training and validating the dataset, the next step involved visualizing the accuracy and loss function graphs.
